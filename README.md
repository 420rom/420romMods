This is a mixed Xposed+Magisk module, which is made to allow customizations that are not originally designed in AOSP (Android Open Source Project). Please read thorough below before reaching to download links
<hr>

### **Features:**
Currently, Pixel Xpert offers customizations on different aspects of system framework and SystemUI, including:
- Status bar
- Quick Settings panel
- Lock screen
- Notifications
- Gesture Navigations
- Phone & Dialer
- Hotspot
- Package Manager
- Screen properties
<hr>

### **Compatibility:**
This MOD is compatible with ROMs or firmware that are built based on fairly unmodified Android (AOSP) source code. This means stock firmware from third party manufacturers like Sony, Motorola, Nokia, Asus, Oneplus, Nothing, etc. may not support all (or in some cases any) of the features of AOSPMods. The same concept applies to custom ROMs (like EvolutionX, Proton, LineageOS, AncientOS, etc). So far, it was reported that this MOD is compatible with Pixel stock firmware fully and with Pixel Experience (normal edition) with some small issues.

AOSPMods is based on "pure" AOSP. Any changes in the ROM source code may (or may not) break the compatiblity. And thus, follow below to see which AOSPMods to use:

- Android 12/12.1: [final version: v2.4.1](https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- Android 13 stable (up until November 2022 firmware): [final version: v.2.4.1](https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- Android 13 stable QPR3 and beta QPR4 (starting from December 2022 firmware till QPR3): [starting with v.2.5](https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert/releases/tag/v2.5.0) up until latest canary version
- Android 14 beta3.1: [starting with v.2.9](https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert/releases/tag/v2.9.0) up until latest canary version
<hr>

### **Prerequisites:**
- Compatible ROM (see Compatibility text above)
- Device Rooted with Magisk 24.2+ or KSU
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version preferred)
<hr>

### **How to install:**
- Download the stable magisk module according to your firmware as mentioned above 
- Install in magisk/KSU
- Reboot (no bootloops are expected)
- Open AOSPMods app and apply changes

P.S. For KSU, there is an extra step of granting root access to PixelXpert as it doesn't request automatically as in Magisk
<hr>

### **Release Variants:**  
The module is also released in 2 flavors with different download and update procedures.

<ins>Stable release:</ins> 
- Manual Install/Update: through repository's Github release page (link below) AND through in-app updater  
- Automated updates: through magisk manager, or through in-app updater

<ins>Canary release:</ins>

- Automated install/updates: through in-app updater - updates will NOT count against the module's download count  

*No matter which flavor you're on, you can always switch to the other one with in-app updater
