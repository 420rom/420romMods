### For Pixel Stock Android 13 and 14  

This is a mixed Xposed+Magisk module, which is made to allow customizations that are not originally designed in AOSP (Android Open Source Project). Please read thorough below before reaching to download links
<hr>

### **Features:**
Currently, Mods offers customisations on different aspects of system framework and SystemUI, including:
- Status bar
- Quick Settings panel
- Lock screen
- Notifications
- Gesture Navigations
- Phone & Dialer
- Hotspot
- Package Manager
- Screen properties
<hr>

### **Compatibility:**
This MOD is compatible with ROMs or firmware that are built based on fairly unmodified Android (AOSP) source code. This means stock firmware from third party manufacturers like Sony, Motorola, Nokia, Asus, Oneplus, Nothing, etc. may not support all (or in some cases any) of the features of AOSPMods. The same concept applies to custom ROMs (like EvolutionX, Proton, LineageOS, AncientOS, etc). So far, it was reported that this MOD is compatible with Pixel stock firmware fully and with Pixel Experience (normal edition) with some small issues.

AOSPMods is based on "pure" AOSP. Any changes in the ROM source code may (or may not) break the compatiblity. And thus, follow below to see which AOSPMods to use:

### **Prerequisites:**
- Compatible ROM (see Compatibility text above)
- Device Rooted with Magisk 24.2+
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version preferred)
<hr>

### **How to install:**
- Download the stable magisk module according to your firmware as mentioned above 
- Install in magisk
- Reboot (no bootloops are expected)
- Open AOSPMods app and apply changes
<hr>

### **Package Variants:**  
Apart from modification on system elements, AOSPMods also includes a number of system overlays to modify fonts, system icons and colors.
However, for those who are not interested on such overlays, we have added an Xposed-only package which, as the name says, only includes the system modification, without such system overlays. You can choose either package, and install the chosen one on your device.

<ins>Xposed Package:</ins>
- Includes only Xposed-based modification and has a rather smaller file-size. This is the one that module developers also use.

<ins>Full Package:</ins>
- Includes everything present in Xposed package, plus additional system overlay options.
