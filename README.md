**Compatibility:**
These mods are designed based on AOSP source code. What does it mean? it means that they are expected to work on Roms (Firmwares) which are built based on fairly unmodified Android source code. This means, mainly, Pixel Phones (3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6), and any other Roms that haven't heavily modified the original Android codes.

- Android 12: Compatible
- Android 12.1 (12L): Compatible
- Andriod 12.1 beta: Compatible
- Android 13 Poorly Compatible (not recommended)


**Prerequisits:**
- Compatible Roms (see above)
- Device Rooted by Magisk 24.2+
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version)


**How to install: (Make sure to read post #2 (FAQ) carefully before you proceed)**
- Install the magisk module
- Reboot (bootloops are not expected)
