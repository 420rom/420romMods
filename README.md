- Lock screen
- Notifications
- Gesture Navigations
- Phone & Dialer
- Hotspot
- Package Manager
- Screen properties
<hr>

### **Compatibility:**
This MOD is compatible with ROMs or firmware that are built based on fairly unmodified Android (AOSP) source code. This means stock firmware from "manufacturers" like Sony, Motorola, Nokia, Asus, Oneplus, Nothing are NOT supported. So far it was reported that this MOD is compatible with Pixel stock firmware and Pixel Experience (normal edition) with some small issues. Other custom ROMs with less modifications have some broken features, but most other custom ROMs are NOT supported at all. Do NOT ask us whether "can I install this on X ROM"! Installing this in any else ROM/firmware is under your supervision! Users asking or reporting from unsupported custom ROMs will get 0 response and may even result in warns.

"Each and every" Android in the world (from begining of Android 1 to now and in the future: Pixel, Samsung, Oneplus, etc - Custom ROMs: LOS, Evo, PE, etc) is based on AOSP. AOSP means: Android open source project. Every Android firmware is from the AOSP project.

BUT: There's only one Android which is almost 100% matching AOSP original code. That's pixel firmware. Others have differences that developers or maintainers have made into them. Some have small differences, some have more.

AOSPMods is based on "pure" AOSP. any changes in the rom may (or may not) break the compatiblity. And thus, follow below to see which AOSPMods to use:

- Android 12/12.1: [final version: v2.4.1](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- Android 13 stable (up until November 2022 firmware): [final version: v.2.4.1](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- Android 13 stable (starting from December 2022 firmware till QPR3): [starting with v.2.5](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.5.0) up until latest canary version
- Android 14 beta3.1: [starting with v.2.9](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.9.0) up until latest canary version
<hr>

### **Prerequisites:**
- Compatible ROM (see Compatibility text above)
- Device Rooted with Magisk 24.2+
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version preferred)
<hr>

### **How to install:**
- Download the stable magisk module according to your firmware as mentioned above 
- Install in magisk
- Reboot (no bootloops are expected)

<hr>

### **Variants:**  
Apart from modification on system elements, AOSPMods also includes a number of system overlays to modify fonts, system icons and colors.
However, for those who are not interested on such overlays, we have added an Xposed-only package which, as the name says, only includes the system modification, without such system overlays. You can choose either package, and install the chosen one on your device.

<ins>Xposed Package:</ins>
- Includes only Xposed-based modification and has a rather smaller file-size. This is the one that module developers also use.

<ins>Full Package:</ins>
- Includes everything present in Xposed package, plus additional system overlay options.
  
The module is also released in 2 flavors with different download and update procedures.

<ins>Stable release:</ins> 
- Manual Install/Update: through repository's Github release page (link below) AND through in-app updater  
- Automated updates: through magisk manager, or through in-app updater

<ins>Canary release:</ins>
- Manual Install/Update: only through repository's Actions page  
- Automated install/updates: only through in-app updater - updates will NOT appear in release section, and will NOT count against the module's download count  

*No matter which flavor you're on, you can always switch to the other one with in-app updater
